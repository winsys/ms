(* BLOBDEMO.PAS for TCompress V3.0 (only comments changed from V2.5)

   This unit provides example code for two things:
   1. On-the-fly creation of compressed blob fields
   2. Writing and reading of any kind of data (e.g. arrays, AVI, WAV etc)
      to/from a compressed blob field.

   Before running the program, you need to use the Database Desktop to create
   a table called BLOB.DB in the DBDEMOS alias which contains a 'Name' field (A10)
   and a 'Data' field (B0). For a full test, you'd also want to add routines
   to put meaningful data into the OurData array, and display it
   before/after blob reads.  We're just compressing a bunch of zeros...

  the field ('Data' in this case) should *not* appear in the list of fields
  you see when you double-click on the Grid or on Table1. If it is, remove it.
  If the list is blank, add whatever you need, but NOT 'Data'.            }

  BlobDataField.DataSet := Table1;
  try
    Table1.Open;  { Note: In Delphi 2.0+, we've edited our grid (double-click) to ensure
                  that the new field will NOT be added to the grid. This is
                  because the V2.0 grids try to detail with (and display) it as
                  a TBlobfield instead of a TCBlobfield, which causes spurious
                   "Blob not open" errors. Please adopt the same tactic if you
                   are working with custom blob fields like this in Delphi 2.
                 }

(*
 This code here would be FINE except that for a Delphi VCL/BDE bug,
   -- telling it to create a table with a ftBlob field size zero
   (something perfectly possible in Database Desktop) results
   in a table with a ftBlob ('B') field size 1. This is a baaad
   thing and doesn't work for our purposes. So alas, we have to ask you
   to create the demo table manually. Sorry about that. It's a pain.

UPDATE April 97: This commented-out code should now work for Delphi 1, but
only by exploiting another bug which arises from setting TableType to ttDefault
instead of ttParadox. However, the GOOD news is that there is a VCL patch
available to remove the original bug -- for all Delphi versions. If you want
to know how to create a table with a 0-length Blob field in it, see
http://www.spis.co.nz/blobfix.htm

    with Table1 do
    begin
      DatabaseName := 'DBDEMOS';
      TableName := 'BLOB.DB';
      TableType := ttDefault; { if ttParadox, Delphi 1 will misbehave again }
      with FieldDefs do
      begin
        Clear;
        Add('Name', ftString, 10,True);
        Add('Data', ftBlob, 0,False);  { bzzzt -- wrong -- makes size 1, dammit! }
      end;
      IndexDefs.Clear;
      CreateTable;
      FieldDefs.Clear;
      temptable.free;
      Table1.Open; { open should work this time... but won't, due to above "spec" }
    end;
*)      { so instead, we: }
     showMessage('Please create a table called BLOB.DB in the'+#13+
                 'DBDEMOS alias, according to the specs in BLOBDEMO.PAS.'+#13+#13+
                 'THEN run this program again.');
