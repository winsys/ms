>>>>> If you ordered the registered version of TCompress, see REGINFO.TXT

These components are fully functional SHAREWARE.

You are encouraged to pass them on, upload them to BBS, Web and 
ftp sites and generally spread them around as much as you can
-- but please keep all the files together!

If you find TCompress useful, registration will get you the
latest version, a personal ID to eliminate the occasional
reminder message, access to our highly regarded (and, I have
to say it, rarely needed) support AND a nice warm
fuzzy feeling.

Registration details are at the end of this file.

===== ALSO SEE COMPRESS.HLP AND FAQ.TXT FOR MUCH MORE INFORMATION =====

  (file/memory/blob/resource<-->file/memory/blob)
* Event hooks for customizable user interaction
* Built-in RLE (Run-Length Encoding) and LZH5
  (Lempel-Ziv-Huffman) compression

* Functions and examples to support compressed resources
  and self-extracting EXEs
* CompressString and ExpandString utility methods
* Key-based compressed data encryption
* Loads of example source included
* Full component source code available

2. Quick Installation
   (This is for experienced people in a hurry. For detailed instructions,
    DO see the Installation section of COMPRESS.HLP, *especially*
    Delphi 3/4 users! Also see the File List below for more details).

*   Unzip the appropriate DnDCUS.ZIP file (e.g. D4DCUS.ZIP is
    for Delphi 4.0, C3OBJS.ZIP is for C++ Builder 3.0)
*   Delphi 1.0/2.0: install COMPRESS.DCU and COMPCTRL.DCU
    into your component library
*   Delphi 3.0/4.0: Install the compdb40.dpk package into your
    component library  (File|Open|compdb40.dpk, Compile|Install)
*   C++ Builder: Install COMPRESS.OBJ/HPP and COMPCTRL.OBJ/HPP
     into your component library
*   Load the COMPDEMO project, compile and run it (if you are
    using Delphi 1.0, see the notes at the top of COMPMAIN.PAS)
*   Examine COMPMAIN.PAS for numerous examples of how to use
    the compression components

Note: TCompress and its companions provide very comprehensive
data compression capabilities. Most developers might only need
to drop a TCompress component on their form and call its ExpandFile/CompressFile
methods in order to create and work with their own multi-file archives...

Others might drop TCDBMemo/TCDBImage/TCDBRichText components
on as well and simply interact with them to have text and picture data
automatically compressed when they are stored in a database.

...and some developers might use the TCBlobfield class to store all kinds
of data (sound, numbers, video etc) directly into compressed database blobs
-- see the BLOB.DPR (BLOB.MAK for C++) demonstration for an example of this.

Brief description:

TCompress provides native components for the creation of 
multi-file compressed archives, as well as database, file,
resource and in-memory compression using streams.
Three compression methods (RLE, LZH and LZH5) are built in, with
"hooks" for the easy addition of custom compression formats.

TCompress also includes drop 'n play components for automatic
database blob, image, rich text and memo compression, based on the
VCL's TDBMemo, TDBRichText and TDBImage components.

Images compress by up to 99% when using LZH, hence there is a
massive saving in disk space and disk or network access when
using these components.

TCompress comes with an extensive demonstration, many source
examples and comprehensive help and keyword files. Supports
Delphi 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and C++ Builder 1.0, 3.0

**** Other components you should check out:

* TSegCompress by Ken McClain (kmcclain@mindspring.com).
TSegCompress builds on TCompress to allow you to create segmented archives,
e.g. for saving one archive onto several floppies.

Download from http://www.mindspring.com/~kmcclain/segment.htm

* TCompLHA LHarc/LHA Archive Manager
Whereas TCompress is crafted to handle a wide range of
general-purpose compression tasks, TCompLHA is specifically
tailored to create and manage archives compatible with the
popular freeware LHArc and LHA utilities (these archives are also
compatible with other utilities like WinZip). TCompLHA can also
read TCompress multi-file archives. An exceptionally easy interface
gives you maximum results with almost no development effort, but
powerful event hooks are provided to give you full control if needed.
