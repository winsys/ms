Zeos Database Objects is a Delphi's components set for direct
access to OpenSource databases: MySql, PostgreSql and Interbase.
Also we propose components for direct access to commerce
databases: MS SQL and Oracle.

Package contains following components:

Dbware crossdatabase components

  TZUpdateSql - component for manual managing of postings.
  TZBatchSql - component for executing sql scripts
  TZMonitor - viewing outgoing queries

Direct access to MySql

  TZMySqlDatabase - connect to sql-server
  TZMySqlTransact - postings and transactions manager
  TZMySqlQuery - execution and opening sql-queries
  TZMySqlTable - opening tables

Direct access to PostgreSql

  TZPgSqlDatabase - connect to sql-server
  TZPgSqlTransact - postings and transactions manager
  TZPgSqlQuery - execution and opening sql-queries
  TZPgSqlTable - opening tables

Direct access to Interbase

  TZIbSqlDatabase - connect to sql-server
  TZIbSqlTransact - postings and transactions manager
  TZIbSqlQuery - execution and opening sql-queries
  TZIbSqlTable - opening tables

Notes: To implement Interbase autoincrement fields create generator
with name "<TableName>_<FieldName>_gen" and turn on 
Query.ExtraOptions[ioAutoIncKey]. Field should be a primary key.
For example: 
  CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerNo INTEGER NOT NULL,
    ...
    PRIMARY KEY (CustomerNo)
  );
  CREATE GENERATOR Customers_CustomerNo_Gen;

Direct access to MS SQL

  TZMsSqlDatabase - connect to sql-server
  TZMsSqlTransact - postings and transactions manager
  TZMsSqlQuery - execution and opening sql-queries
  TZMsSqlTable - opening tables
  TZMsSqlStoredProc - stored procedures with various parameter types

Direct access to Oracle8

  TZOraSqlDatabase - connect to sql-server
  TZOraSqlTransact - postings and transactions manager
  TZOraSqlQuery - execution and opening sql-queries
  TZOraSqlTable - opening tables

Notes: To implement Interbase autoincrement fields create sequence
with name "<TableName>_<FieldName>_seq" and turn on 
Query.ExtraOptions[ooAutoIncKey]. Field should be a primary key.
For example: 
  CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerNo INTEGER NOT NULL,
    ...
    PRIMARY KEY (CustomerNo)
  );
  CREATE SEQUENCE Customers_CustomerNo_Seq;

All TDataset descendants have next features:

  - Different datatypes supported (Integer, String, Float, Boolean)
  - Edit simple and complex queries (in complex queries is updated 
    only first table)
  - Cached updates support
  - Blobs support
  - Locate and Lookups
  - Master-Detail support
  - Master-Detail cascade deletes and updates support
  - Onclient and onserver filtering
  - UpdateSql object for control update postings
